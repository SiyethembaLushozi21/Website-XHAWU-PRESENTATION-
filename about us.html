        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The (SME) initiative led by Precious Radebe. The initiative focuses on providing skills training for domestic workers and gardeners, particular those who have not had the opportunity to upskill or gain formal education, like her parents and other elderly relatives.</p>
        <p>The training helps these individuals become more marketable, secure higher-paying jobs and even start their own small businesses. Many employees are interested in having their domestic staff receive this training to enhance the range of skilled services they offer.</p>
